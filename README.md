## fully_connected_readmission_prediction

data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#

After data processing, I tried to use all available features to predict readmission for diabetes patients via a fully connected neural network, only to find out that predictions gave by the neural network is either all positive or all negative. 

Still looking for a solution.
